Feature: Essay (WIRIS) response-format input options
    In order to trust every Essay (WIRIS) response-format option
    As a student
    I want each response format (HTML editor, plain text, monospaced) and the attachments option to work in an attempt

    # An Essay (WIRIS) question exposes the core essay response options: the
    # "responseformat" controls the answer input (editor = HTML editor,
    # plain = plain text box, monospaced = fixed-width plain text box) and
    # "attachments" adds a file-upload area. The essay answer is always fillable, so
    # each text response format is exercised end to end (typed and the saved
    # response is shown on review). Essays are graded manually, so no automatic
    # grade is asserted here (manual grading is covered by manual_grading.feature).
    # The response-format / attachments options are scalar question fields, so the
    # questions are built directly with generator columns.
